# ETL Challenge - Austin Breweries <!-- omit in toc -->

## Background

For this project I am practicing the Extract, Transform and Load process with data I accessed from multiple sources. The first extraction was performed by web scraping this blog (https://bigworldsmallgirl.com/central-texas-brewery-guide/) using the Beautiful Soup Python Library. The second extraction used an API to query (https://untappd.com/). 

After extracting the data form these two sources, I used Pandas to perform some basic data cleaning and formatting. 

Lastly, I loaded the data into a postgres SQL database using the built in Pandas.to_sql() function and SQLAlchemy.
